# Buttler

Buttler is a mobile app that uses crowd-sourced waste management to map cigarette butts. With cigarette butts being the most littered item in the world, this app intends to map their locations to identify problem areas. By using a map to visualize the data, we can more easily see the geographical distribution.

## Technology

The mobile app uses React Native to allow for cross-platform development. The backend includes a .NET API that is deployed on Google Cloud. The data is then persisted on a PostgreSQL database that is hosted by RDS from Amazon.

## Installation

To run this project locally, you will need to have the following installed:

- Node.js
- React Native
- PostgreSQL
- .NET

After installing the necessary dependencies, clone the repository to your local machine and run the following commands:

```
cd Buttler
npm install
```


## Usage

To start the app, run the following command:


```
npm start
```

This will start the React Native Metro Bundler. Once the bundler has started, you can run the app on your mobile device or emulator using the Expo app.
